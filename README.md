# Pico-FreeRTOS-Starter-Pack
I've been trying to get the FreeRTOS running with c++ on Raspberry Pico with the VSCode esxtension for a while. It takes some work to setup the dev environment properly, I created this to help you easily start working on Raspberry Pico with FreeRTOS on the new VSCode Extension. Just clone this repo, install the VSCode extension, and hit compile. 

- Install VSCode extension for Pico [Github](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode) (you can search for it as well)
- clone the repo "git clone https://github.com/abdukir/Pico-FreeRTOS-Starter-Pack.git
- update submodules "git submodule update --init --recursive"
- Configure cmake, and build
